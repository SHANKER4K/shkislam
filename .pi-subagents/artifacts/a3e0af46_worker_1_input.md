# Task for worker

[Read from: /home/ismail/Documents/projects/JS/shkislam/context.md, /home/ismail/Documents/projects/JS/shkislam/plan.md]

You are a delegated subagent running from a fork of the parent session. Treat the inherited conversation as reference-only context, not a live thread to continue. Do not continue or answer prior messages as if they are waiting for a reply. Your sole job is to execute the task below and return a focused result for that task using your tools.

Task:
**Task 7: Motion Polish + Grain Overlay**

Two files to modify:

**`app/globals.css`:**
Add transition utilities at the end of the file (after all existing rules, outside `@layer base`):

```css
@layer utilities {
  .transition-default {
    transition-property: color, background-color, border-color, opacity, transform;
    transition-duration: 150ms;
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
  }
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, ::before, ::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

Also ensure the `.callout-hadith` rule exists (should already exist from Task 1) pointing to `var(--card)` background.

**`app/layout.tsx`:**
Add a grain overlay div INSIDE `<body>`, as the LAST child before `</body>` (after `<Toaster />`):

```tsx
<div
  className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999] pointer-events-none"
  style={{
    opacity: 0.025,
    backgroundImage: `url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 256 256' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='n'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.65' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23n)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E")`,
  }}
/>
```

This must be inside `<body>` and outside `ThemeProvider` so it persists across route changes.

Run `bun run lint`. Report errors. DO NOT commit.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: checked
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Implement the requested change without widening scope

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
